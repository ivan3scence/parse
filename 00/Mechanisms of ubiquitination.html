1) The unique E1 "ubiquitin-activating" enzyme activates ubiquitin by
binding it to one of its own cysteins.<br>
<br>
2) It then passes ubiquitin onto one among several dozens of E2
"ubiquitin-conjugating" enzymes. Here again, the C-terminus of
ubiquitin is bound via a cystein.<br>
<br>
3) One among hundreds of E3 "ubiquitin ligase" enzymes transfers
ubiquitin to its final protein target. The C-teminus of ubiquitin is
linked to the NH2 side chain of a lysine in the target, forming a
covalent peptide bond.<br>
<br>
4) Because ubiquitin itself contains 7 lysines, it is possible to build
chains of ubiquitins onto the target protein. This may require the same
or a different E3, and possibly the help of an E4 enzyme.<br>
<br>
5) Specialized enzymes known as de-ubiquitinases (DUB) can shorten the
chains, or even remove all ubiquitins from the target protein.<br>
<br>
<h1>Fate of ubiquitinated proteins</h1>
Depending on the number of ubiquitin moeties, and on the type of chains
(i.e. which one of the 7 lysines in ubiquitin is used to grow the
chain), the effect on the target protein may differ widely.<br>
<br>
Some chains, mainly those using lysine 48 in ubiquitin, tag the target
protein for degradation in the 26S proteasome, as soon as the chain
grows beyond 4 ubiquitins.<br>
But other chain types, as well as mono-ubiquitination, can serve to
modulate the activity of the target protein.<br>
